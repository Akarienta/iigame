# I&I Game

## About
Everyone needs relaxing sometimes, almost everyone loves sex and most of us like playing games. This app is here to connect all these three things together and improve your sexual experiences.

### Connection with Manna
[Manna Francis](http://www.mannazone.org/) wrote a great fiction called The Administration and this app is loosely inspired by it. However, if you haven't read it it doesn't matter - I can highly recommend it but it doesn't affort usage of this app. Only name of Investigation & Interrogation division was taken from the fiction and this is exactly what this app is about. Of course, if you are fan of Manna's work, feel free to name your accounts after Toreth and Warrick :-)

### Disclaimer
**Warning:** If you know nothing about BDSM or don't like it, this app probably isn't for you. The same thing is when you are under 18 or simply under law in your country. Anyway, author doesn't take any consequences for possible injury got by usage of this app.

### Use Cases
#### ...if your are dom (top)
Your partner knows a secret password. He/she thinks that he/she will never ever tell you even if you do whatever you are able to, whatever you can or whatever you want to do. Do you think he/she is right?

#### ...if you are sub (bottom)
You know a secret password and your partner really wants to know. He/she can do whatever is able to, whatever he/she can and whatever he/she wants to do. Oh, really? God be with you.

This app is here to help you realize this scenario. It helds the passwords and is able to validate them. No cheats, no mistakes, simply setup, short preparation - just you, your partner and your investigation and interrogation game. And computer or mobile phone, of course.
